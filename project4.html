            JAVA was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems Inc in the
            year 1991, later acquired by Oracle Corporation. It is a simple
            programming language. Java makes writing, compiling, and debugging
            programming easy. It helps to create reusable code and modular
            programs. Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming
            language and is designed to have as few implementation dependencies
            as possible. A general-purpose programming language made for
            developers to write once run anywhere that is compiled Java code can
            run on all platforms that support Java. Java applications are
            compiled to byte code that can run on any Java Virtual Machine. The
            syntax of Java is similar to c/c++.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Java Class Library (JCL) is a set of dynamically loadable
            libraries that Java Virtual Machine (JVM) languages can call at run
            time. Because the Java Platform is not dependent on a specific
            operating system, applications cannot rely on any of the
            platform-native libraries. Instead, the Java Platform provides a
            comprehensive set of standard class libraries, containing the
            functions common to modern operating systems. JCL serves three
            purposes within the JVM:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Like other standard code libraries, they provide the programmer a
              well-known set of useful facilities, such as container classes and
              regular expression processing.
            </li>
            <li>
              The library provides an abstract interface to tasks that would
              normally depend heavily on the hardware and operating system, such
              as network access and file access.
            </li>
            <li>
              Some underlying platforms may not support all of the features a
              Java application expects. In these cases, the library
              implementation can either emulate those features or provide a
              consistent way to check for the presence of a specific feature.

          <p>
            In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
            declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
            number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string
            values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the
            more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model
            provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary
            for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without
            any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of
            objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
          </p>
          <p>
            ava is a general purpose programming language, much like Python or
            JavaScript. The language itself is specifically an object oriented
            programming language, so bears similarities to C++, C#. Java is also
            a platform, which means that Java code can run on any machine that
            has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) on it. Originally those two things
            were interchangeable, and the only thing that ran on the JVM was
            Java. But since that time, a number of languages have been written
            which can run on the Java platform, languages like Scala, Groovy, an
            implementation of Ruby called jRuby, and an implementation of Python
            called Jython.

          Variable in Java is a data container that saves the data values during
          Java program execution. Every variable is assigned a data type that
          designates the type and quantity of value it can hold. Variable is a
          memory location name of the data.

          Variable in Java is a data container that saves the data values during
          Java program execution. Every variable is assigned a data type that
          designates the type and quantity of value it can hold. Variable is a
          memory location name of the data. A variable is a name given to a
          memory location. For More On Variables please check Variables in Java.
        </p>
        <p>
          A variable name can consist of Capital letters A-Z, lowercase letters
          a-z digits 0-9, and two special characters such as _ underscore and $
          dollar sign. The first character must be a letter. Blank spaces cannot
          be used in variable names. Java keywords cannot be used as variable
          names. Variable names are case-sensitive. The maximum length of the
          variable is 64 characters. Variable names always should exist on the
          left-hand side of assignment operators.

        <article>
          You can declare a variable in three ways:
          <p>
            With the keyword var. For example, <code>var x = 42.</code> This
            syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
          </p>
          <p>
            By simply assigning it a value. For example,
            <code>x = 42.</code> This always declares a global variable. It
            generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this
            variant.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the keyword let. For example,<code> let y = 13.</code> This
            syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See
            Variable scope below.
          </p>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
        <header>Variable scope</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Scope of a variable is the part of the program where the variable is
            accessible. Like C/C++, in Java, all identifiers are lexically (or
            statically) scoped, i.e.scope of a variable can determined at
            compile time and independent of function call stack. Java programs
            are organized in the form of classes. Every class is part of some
            package. Java scope rules can be covered under following categories.
          </p>

          <p>
            These variables must be declared inside class (outside any
            function). They can be directly accessed anywhere in class.We can
            declare class variables anywhere in class, but outside methods.
            Access specified of member variables doesn’t affect scope of them
            within a class. Member variables can be accessed outside a class
            with following rules
          </p>
          <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } System.out(x); // 5</code>
          <p>
            This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
            ECMAScript 2015.
          </p>

          <code
            >if (true) { let y = 5; } System.out(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
            defined</code

      <section class="main-section" id="Global_variables">
        <header>Global variables</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            To define a Global variable in java, the keyword static is used.
            Java actually doesn’t have the concept of Global variable, it is
            known as class variable ( static field ). These are the variables
            that can be used by the entire class.
          </p>

          <p>
            To define the Global Variable, you can just use the static Keyword
            like this: public class Example { public static int a; public static
            int b; }
          </p>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
        <header>Constants</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword.
            The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
            identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign
            and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
          </p>

          <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
          <p>
            A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared
            while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.
          </p>

          <p>
            The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block
            scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is
            assumed to represent a variable.
          </p>

          <p>
            You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
            variable in the same scope. For example:
          </p>

          <code
            >// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS
            WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g;
            //statements }</code
          >
          However, object attributes are not protected, so the following
          statement is executed without problems.
          <code
            >const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key =
            "otherValue";</code

          <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines Eight data types:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Eight data types that are primitives:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                <li>
                  byte: The byte data type is an 8-bit signed two’s complement
                  integer. The byte data type is useful for saving memory in
                  large arrays. Syntax: byte byteVar;
                </li>
                <li>
                  short: The short data type is a 16-bit signed two’s complement
                  integer. Similar to byte, use a short to save memory in large
                  arrays, in situations where the memory savings actually
                  matters. Syntax: short shortVar;
                </li>
                <li>
                  int: It is a 32-bit signed two’s complement integer. Syntax:
                  int intVar;
                </li>
                <li>
                  long: The long data type is a 64-bit two’s complement integer.
                  Syntax: long longVar;
                </li>
                <li>
                  float: The float data type is a single-precision 32-bit IEEE
                  754 floating-point. Use a float (instead of double) if you
                  need to save memory in large arrays of floating-point numbers.
                  Syntax: float floatVar;
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              double: The double data type is a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754
              floating-point. For decimal values, this data type is generally
              the default choice. Syntax: double doubleVar;
            </li>
            <li>
              char: The char data type is a single 16-bit Unicode character.
              Syntax: char charVar;
            </li>
          </ul>
          The Reference Data Types will contain a memory address of variable
          values because the reference types won’t store the variable value
          directly in memory. They are strings, objects, arrays, etc.

      <section class="main-section" id="if...else_statement">
        <header>if...else statement</header>
        <article>
          Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
          true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the
          condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:

          <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
          condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
          Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
          condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
          statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any
          statement, including further nested if statements.
          <p>
            You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
            conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
          </p>
          <code
            >if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) {
            statement_2; } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else {
            statement_last; }
          </code>
          In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition
          which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple
          statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In
          general, it's good practice to always use block statements, especially
          when nesting if statements:

          <code
            >if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
            statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
            statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
            statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code
          >
          It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional
          expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality when
          glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:
          <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code> If you need to use
          an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put
          additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:

          <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
        <header>while statement</header>
        <article>
          A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified
          condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:

          <code>while (condition) statement</code> If the condition becomes
          false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to
          the statement following the loop.

          <p>
            The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed.
            If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the
            condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution
            stops and control is passed to the statement following while.
          </p>

          <p>
            To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to
            group those statements.
          </p>

          Example:

          <p>
            The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:
          </p>

          <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &lt; 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
          <p>
            With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
            Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
            <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
            <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt; 3 is no longer
            true, so the loop terminates.

          A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
          statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

          <ul>
            <li>The name of the function.</li>
            <li>
              A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
              separated by commas.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Java statements that define the function, enclosed in curly
              brackets, { }.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For example, the following code defines a simple function named
            square:
          </p>

          <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
          <p>
            The function square takes one argument, called number. The function
            consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the
            function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return
            statement specifies the value returned by the function.
          </p>
          <code>return number * number;</code>
          <p>
            Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by
            value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function
            changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected
            globally or in the calling function.
